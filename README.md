# Ralc

Ralc is a simple programming language that uses [reverse polish notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation) for its syntax. This was a university assignment project.

Ralc programs can be executed in REPL (Read-eval-print loop) tool. Here are a few examples of simple ralc programs:

```
